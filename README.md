Python_Project
==============
The text file contains data needed for the python files and will need to be put in the same directory in order for it to run.

The python files are a project I made during University to deduce some fundamental constants of the Universe using high and low red shift supernovae data. The milestone.py is nicely commented and laid out as it was being assessed. 

The extension.py was an addition I made to it in order to find out some extra properties and use all the available data. Therefore the extension is less nice looking as it's designed just for getting the values out I need at the end.
